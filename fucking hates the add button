fucking hates the add button
####

	this looks like shit
		there's a 2 in aaron

	there's nothing to click on
		what do I cl to get into pantry

	icons are good
	 	found the add icon

	which category are these things

	upvoted twice
		need a way to keep that from happening

	making a pantry:
		what the fuck the fuck is this 
		not sure what add emails mean
			is that 
			and there's not multiple emails

		the fuck is this
			the edit buttion
		the add thing is ambiguous
			not sure what it points to

		bacardi doesn't have a category
			adding to dairy
		
		thought he was in pantry
			was in shopping list
		request it
			moved it to the pantry

		jumbled fonts suck in my_pantries

	sharing
		
	the add bar should be off to the side
		add what?

	create new pantry is a problem
		
	can I share this with people outside of east?

	edit an entry
		edit my entry

	fuck I added to the pantry and not the shopping cart

	move shit from the 

	what if the list is too long
		and then I add something that 

	what is this sort thing, and it doesn't work
		so we demonstrate that functionality by
			animation!
		why does it sort upper case first

		sort by likes is useful

	lack of option focuses functionality

	streamline a little more

consider differentiating between users
	not if it wastes more time
		
there should a button for my_pantries

only having one pantry is a problem in the homepage
sharing of shopping lists along
